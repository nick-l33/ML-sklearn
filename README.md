# ML-scikit-learn
Demos of applying ML algorithm(s) from scikit-learn library to predict outcomes from different datasets:
1a. __binclsf_heartdisease__: Binary classification to predict risk of heart disease from dataset containing blinded clinical/patient data.
1b. __binclsf_legendary_pokemon__: Binary classification to predict Legendary Pokemon from dataset containing pokemon characteristics and/or stats.
1c. __binclsf_seattlespecialevents__: Binary classification to predict permit status of special events held in Seattle.
2a. __regr_emission__: Regression ML algorithm to build empirical model for predicting CO and NOX concentrations in the emitted flue gas from gas turbine power plant.
2b. __regr_powerplant__: Regression technique to build empirical model for predicting output power of combined cycle power plant from operating data.
