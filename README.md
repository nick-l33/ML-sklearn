# ML-scikit-learn
Demos of applying ML algorithm(s) from scikit-learn library to predict outcomes from different datasets:
1. __binclsf___heartdisease: Binary classification to predict risk of heart disease from dataset containing blinded clinical/patient data.
2. __binclsf___legendary_pokemon: Binary classification to predict Legendary Pokemon from dataset containing pokemon characteristics and/or stats.
3. __binclsf___seattlespecialevents: Binary classification to predict permit status of special events held in Seattle.
4. __regr___emission: Regression ML algorithm to build empirical model for predicting CO and NOX concentrations in the emitted flue gas from gas turbine power plant.
5. __regr___powerplant: Regression technique to build empirical model for predicting output power of combined cycle power plant from operating data.
