# ML-scikit-learn
Demos of applying ML algorithm(s) from scikit-learn library to predict outcomes from different datasets:
1. __binclsfy_heartdisease__: Binary classification to predict risk of heart disease from dataset containing blinded clinical/patient data.
2. __binclsfy_legendary_pokemon__: Binary classification to predict Legendary Pokemon from dataset containing pokemon characteristics and/or stats.
3. __binclsfy_seattlespecialevents__: Binary classification to predict permit status of special events held in Seattle.
4. __drug_discoveryML__: Classification/Regression to predict bioactivity of molecules with drug-like properties from ChEMBL database.
5. __mltclsfy_acp__: Multiclass classification model to predict activity of anticancer peptides against breast and lung cancer cell lines.
6. __regr_emission__: Regression ML algorithm to build empirical model for predicting CO and NOX concentrations in the emitted flue gas from gas turbine power plant.
7. __regr_powerplant__: Regression technique to build empirical model for predicting output power of combined cycle power plant from operating data.
